<span class="subtitle">The two shots above are from a little bit of freelance work from a client overseas. The website was designed, prototyped and coded all by myself, utilizing Wordpress and ACF so the client could manage his content without any issues.

<span class="subtitle">This one is a very specific shot that I like very much. We had the need to show the exhibitors so that the user could select and receive more information about them, such as booth position and products offered by them. The solution found was crisp clean and worked very well.</span>
