job: "UX/UI, Project Management and a little bit of Front-End"
intro: "<p>E-Commerce Brasil is a project that aims to encourage and make the e-commerce market even bigger than it already is. The project has successfully capacitated thousands of professionals through courses, webinars, articles, and many many events, both free and paid through the year. The biggest one, FÃ³rum E-Commerce Brasil was crowned the biggest e-commerce gathering in the world in 2017.</p>
<p>I was responsable for redesigning the portal from scratch, rethinking many user flows and interactions to make the website more user-friendly, both to the readers as well to the writers. Designing a project with so much content was a big challenge, but the results were amazing.</p>
