Alongside with 3 other blood brothers, who are also well-versed designers, we created this brand from scratch without any money whatsover and turned it into a successfull and known business in the brazillian street wear world. Everything, from designing the apparel and website to figuring out logistics and marketing campaigns, is done exclusively and proudly by us</p>
