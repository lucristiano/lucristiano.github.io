			But what is it?
		</h3>
		<p>In this section I wanted to show a couple of shots for many different projects, and give my five cents about them. It's always going to be a work in progress, but I sincerely hope you like and, and have as much fun as I did crafting them.</p>

<section class="project-images">
	<div class="container">
		<img class="reveal" src="/assets/img/projects/bestshots-1.jpg" />
<span class="subtitle">A work in progress for iMasters, a project that aims to capacitate and encourage the brazillian development market with content, events, workshops and much more. This is a prototype for the Author’s Page.</span>
<img class="reveal" src="/assets/img/projects/bestshots-2.jpg" />
<img class="reveal" src="/assets/img/projects/bestshots-3.jpg" />
<span class="subtitle">The two shots above are from a little bit of freelance work from a client overseas. The website was designed, prototyped and coded all by myself, utilizing Wordpress and ACF so the client could manage his content without any issues. You can check out the real deal <a href="https://www.optimumstone.com.au" target="_blank">over here</a></span>
<img class="reveal" src="/assets/img/projects/bestshots-4.jpg" />
<span class="subtitle">This was an amazing project. I didn’t participate in any of the design, just coded it. It was great to work with a great friend and inspiring designer. You can check out the real deal <a href="http://www.balbino.cc" target="_blank">over here</a></span>
<img class="reveal" src="/assets/img/projects/bestshots-5.jpg" />
<span class="subtitle">This one is a very specific shot that I like very much. We had the need to show the exhibitors so that the user could select and receive more information about them, such as booth position and products offered by them. The solution found was crisp clean and worked very well.</span>
<img class="reveal" src="/assets/img/projects/bestshots-6.jpg" />
<span class="subtitle">Here I was just having some fun with a little bit of iconography. Those were going to be used in a Co-Working page to illustrate the perks of working there. In order: Fast Wi-fi, Free Coffee, Confortable Furniture, Security 24/7, Networking, Pool Table, Kitchen, Access via Mobile, Free Food, Receptionist, Outside Area, and Cold Water.</span>
<img class="reveal" src="/assets/img/projects/bestshots-7.jpg" />
<span class="subtitle">Those were a 100% for fun ¯_(ツ)_/¯<br />
In Order: Squirtle, Charmander and Bulbassaur</span>
