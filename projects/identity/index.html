		<h3>About QuintoAndar</h3>
		<p>QuintoAndar is a brazilian proptech company that is currently helping change the way brazillians rent and buy property. We are currently Brazil's largest digital real estate startup, and the second largest startup in Brazil, currently valued at US$ 4 billion since our last round of investment.</p>
		<p>Our core business, up until today, is rental. We managed to work out a solution to eliminate the need for a guarantor on the rental process, a very common nuisance on brazilian bureacracy, and create a fully digital process so people can find their next home and landlords can make money with their properties, with a guarantee that they will receive their rent on every 12th, even if tenant delay payment for any reason.</p>

		<h3>Main problem</h3>
		<p>As we scaled our services, our product visuals didn't evolve at the same pace. Built on a very material UI like visuals, we needed to create a more proprietary aesthetic on our product to better represent our value proposition.</p>
	</div>
</section>	

<section class="project-description after-accent no-margin">
	<div class="container reveal">
		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<p>To make that vision more tangible, we aimed to create a North Star as a visual output so we could better articulate with other teams what that vision were and how we would achieve it. That process would be split in four main moments:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Establish a visual North Star that we could work towards;</li>
			<li>Revisit the visual foundations on which our product was built;</li>
			<li>Redesign main components based on those new foundations;</li>
			<li>Create guidelines to help our team hone their interface craft;</li>
		</ul>
