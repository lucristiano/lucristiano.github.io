		<h3>About QuintoAndar</h3>
		<p>QuintoAndar is a brazilian proptech company that is currently helping change the way brazillians rent and buy property. We are currently Brazil's largest digital real estate startup, and the second largest startup in Brazil, currently valued at US$ 4 billion since our last round of investment.</p>
		<p>Our core business, up until today, is rental. We managed to work out a solution to eliminate the need for a guarantor on the rental process, a very common nuisance on brazilian bureacracy, and create a fully digital process so people can find their next home and landlords can make money with their properties, with a guarantee that they will receive their rent on every 12th, even if tenant delay payment for any reason.</p>

		<h3>My role</h3>
		<p>The project below was done at September 2020, when I was working as Lead Product Designer at the Scalability team. I will tell the story about how we developed a solution so landlords and tenants could negotiate the value on which their contracts would be renewed anually during a global economic crisis.</p>
