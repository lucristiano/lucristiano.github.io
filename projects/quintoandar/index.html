		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>The project below was done at September 2020, when I was working as Lead Product Designer at the Scalability team. I will tell the story about how we developed a solution so Landlords and Tenants could negotiate the value on which their contracts would be renewed anually. Maintain equilibrium. ad-hoc projects.</p>

		<h3>QuintoAndar</h3>
		<p>QuintoAndar is a brazillian home rentals startup that is currently helping change the way brazillians rent and buy property. We are currently Brazil's largest digital real estate startup, and the second largest startup in Brazil, currently valued at US$ 4 billion since our last round of investments.</p>
		<p>Our core business, up until today, is rental. We managed to work out a solution to eliminate the need for a guarantor on the rental process, a very common nuisance on brazilian bureacracy, and create a fully digital process so people can find their next home and landlords can make money with their properties, with a guarantee that they will receive their rent on every 12th, even if tenant has a problem.</p>

		<h3>Project context</h3>
		<p>As we all know, on 2020 the covid-19 pandemic took the world by storm. no one was ready for it to have such a huge impact on our lives. Brazillians suffered and are still suffering from it to this day. On an economic perspective, Brazil had a huge dip on formal employment and many people lost their jobs or had some impact on their monthly revenue. And the ability to make rent and to keep a low rate of non-payment was crucial for a number of reasons.</p>
		<p>Our economic model was based on a very careful credit analysis, which made possible to keep very low non-payment rates, and those rates kept our ability to keep up with the promise to pay our landlords even if tenants couldn't afford rent that month for any reason;</p>
		<p>Tenants that couldn't afford rent for more than three months could be evicted based on brazilian laws;</p>
		<p>Landlords would also suffer from a loss of income if they lost their tenant on that period;</p>
