		<h3>About QuintoAndar</h3>
		<p>QuintoAndar is a brazillian home rentals startup that is currently helping change the way brazillians rent and buy property. We are currently Brazil's largest digital real estate startup, and the second largest startup in Brazil, currently valued at US$ 4 billion since our last round of investments.</p>
		<p>Our core business, up until today, is rental. We managed to work out a solution to eliminate the need for a guarantor on the rental process, a very common nuisance on brazilian bureacracy, and create a fully digital process so people can find their next home and landlords can make money with their properties, with a guarantee that they will receive their rent on every 12th, even if tenant has a problem.</p>

		<h3>My role</h3>
		<p>The project below was done at September 2020, when I was working as Lead Product Designer at the Scalability team. I will tell the story about how we developed a solution so Landlords and Tenants could negotiate the value on which their contracts would be renewed anually on a global economic crisis.</p>

		<h3>Project context</h3>
		<p>On 2020, the covid-19 pandemic took the world by storm. On an economic perspective, Brazil had a huge dip on formal employment and many people lost their jobs or had some impact on their monthly revenue, puting their ability to make rent at risk.</p>
		<p>Our economic model was based on a very careful credit analysis, which made possible to keep very low non-payment rates, and those rates were crucial to enable us to keep up with the promise to pay our landlords even if tenants couldn't afford rent that month for any reason;</p>
	</div>
</section>	

<section class="project-description after-accent no-margin">
	<div class="container reveal">
		<h3>Main problems</h3>
		<p>The economic scenario alongside with the way rental leases work in Brazil would make that situation even worse. Contracts are renewed on their 12th anniversary, and, for more than 30 years, are adjusted with an index called IPGM (General Market Prices Index) and its value was skyrocketing. On September/20, the index was at 17%, a huge leap from the 3% we had a year from that.</p>
	</div>

		<p>That meant that a rental lease that was, for example, R$ 2.000 would jump to R$ 2.340. Those kind of numbers would have a huge impact on our tenants pockets on a pandemic scenario on which people were more financially fragile.</p>
		<p>As the index would go up and up from March (6%) to AugustÂ (13%), and no perspective for it go down any sooner, those people started reaching out with the necessity to negotiate that adjustment, which wasn't viable until that date.</p>
		<p>So, we had to come up with a solution that would take into account those three main issues - mitigate the risk of non-payment, helping our tenants to make rent on that kind of scenario, and keep that income flowing for our landlords that also depended on that money, all on time to make it viable so contracts that would complete 12 months on September wouldn't be impacted with such a huge adjustment.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="project-description after-accent no-margin">
	<div class="container reveal">
		<h3>Discovery</h3>
		<p>We had about two weeks to have that solution up and running on time for the 3000 contracts that would be adjusted on that month. That number would only go up on the following months would be specially critical on January/21, on which more than 5000 contracts would be completing 12 months.</p>
		<p>Discussing with the team, we had a hypotheshis that, if needed be, Landlords would be flexible on negotiating the rent adjustment, and we could help them making that decision making the process easier. We already had some landlords and owners (about 7% of contracts on their 12th month) reaching an agreement directly, but that number was still low and they had to reach out our internal team to inform us that they had negotiated something different than the IGPM.</p>
		<p>In such a tight schedule, we had to make big trade-offs. We wouldn't have time to either research more deeply the issue and validate that hypotheshis, nor test any solution we came up with. To mitigate the risks of those trade-offs, we made three important decisions:</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Use recent research to support our hypothesis</h3>
		<p>That way, we could gain quickly gain important context and discard any hypothesis that weren't supported by our research.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>The solution had to be the simplest possible, mitigating usability risks</h3>
		<p>We would use our estabilished Design System (named Cozy) and only existing and tested out components to build our solution. We wouldn't have time to create new nor edit existing ones, as the efforts of engineers would be mainly make the discount work and be set up automatically on our back-end.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>We would take an MVP approach for the first wave of contracts, and iterate from there</h3>
		<p>The risk of not testing that solution before launch was very much at our minds, but losing the window of opportunity to stall readjustments for October contracts would be far too risky and painful for our customers. We decided to launch a minimal viable product and learn from that new baseline.</p>
		<p>Our back-end wasn't nearly ready for receiving any sophisticated approach, like offering landlords the opportunity to set up any discount. That implementation would take time that we didn't have, so we had reduced options that could be presented to the landlord. He would be able, on that MVP, only to decline his right to readjustment, keep the readjustment with the IGPM or use another fixed index, which we didn't have.</p>
		<p>That insight made us reach out to our legal and economic teams, who had been looking for alternatives that could help us make a decision fast. They came up with the ideia to offer another market index, IPCA (National Index of Consumer Prices), that was also monthly recalculated and was related to inflation values. That number made sense both from a legal and economic perspective, as from a user perspective, because its value was way closer to what IGPM values used to be on the past (around 3% at that time)</p>

		<h3>Deep dive on research</h3>
		<p>When the pandemic stroke hard in March, our whole product team created a cross effort to articulate a big user research to investigate how the pandemic impacted our users. On that research, we spoke to Tenants and Landlords on different moments of the rent user journey, both before and after signing a lease contract (Pre and Post Contract), and at different moments of an ongoing rent lease (New contracts signed around Covid main outbreak and ongoing contracts with around 6 months and 12 months) about their main concerns on that moment, and we found valuable insights on that research to support our hypothesis.</p>

			For around 50% of landlords with recent contracts, vacancy was their main concern, which would result on more costs and loss of income for them. That number was noticeably higher on longer contracts, reaching almost 70% of their top of mind

		<img class="reveal" src="/assets/img/projects/bestshots-7.jpg" />
		<span class="subtitle">
			We saw that most landlords with ongoing contracts were not open to negotiate rent prices. But that number shifted on longer contracts, on which almost 60% of landlords would be open to negotiate rent discounts during that period. That information picked our interest and strenghted our hypothesis that, if needed, landlords on that situation would make a concession on the rent adjustment to help their tenants to make rent.

		<p>They would receive an e-mail explaining the situation and presenting the options alongside with a link to a small PWA flow to allow them to make that decision;</p>
		<p>On that flow, they could choose to either not have any readjustment at all, use the IPCA index, or to keep the IGPM.</p>
		<p>After they made that decision, we would inform tenant if their rent price was receiving on adjustment on the next month, or not, and give them a link to a direct negotiation with owner if needed, and started working on the templates and screens to make that interaction possible.</p>

		<h3>Delivery</h3>
		<p>We launched the campaing on this format for 3161 contracts on October/20, on which 40% of them opted to negotiate a different value for their adjustment. That was a huge improvement from the 11% contracts that were negotiated on September/20.</p>
		<p>On the next month, the same campaign was launch again for the next batch of contracts (3437) and 79% of them opted to negotiate the index.</p>
		<p>Between September/20 and February/21, almost 23000 contracts were readjusted with a different value than IGPM, that would rank up to almost 80% of our renewed contracts. Part of our landlords accepted IPCA and another part reached another agreement.</p>

		<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
		<p>This project was important to access viability of using IPCA as a market standard. Since November 2020, the official index for new contracts at QuintoAndar became the IPCA, making a huge improvement and move on the real estate context.</p>
		<p>On October/20, that ad-hoc project left my scope and was acommodated by another product team, that would be able to iterate and evolve even more the MVP solution that we came up with.</p>
		<p>On the other team hands, this feature has evolved a lot, and we now have a pretty sophisticated approach to this issue. Besides those three options, landlords and tenants can reach an agreement and choose the percentage or value on which the contract will be readjusted, we have automated campaings and many other touchpoints to this solution.</p>

		<p>This feature had a lot of importance to me. We were able to solve a huge pain on a very delicate time of our lives. The pandemic had and still has a huge impact on our lives, and being able to play a part on making at least that process a little bit less painful made a huge difference for me.</p>
