		<h3>
			But what is it?
		</h3>
		<p>Rosario is the biggest project of my life. Alongside with 3 blood brothers, who are also well-versed designers, we created this brand from scratch without any money whatsover and turned it into a successfull and known business in the brazillian street wear world. Everything, from designing the apparel and website to figuring out logistics, photoshoots, marketing campaigns and overseeing production is done exclusively and proudly by us.</p> <p>Our biggest ambition with it is to have a place so we can exercise our creative freedom while maintaing a long-term growth with high-end products.</p> <p>One of those jobs was designing, coding and mantaining the company website. This concept was created using a minimalistic approach and had the objective of providing the user with a simple, yet sophisticated purchase experience.</p> <p>It's really hard to sum up +7 years of work in a project in just a couple of shots. We've come pretty far. But below, I tried to show a little bit of what we do. But if you want the bigger picture, you can check out our <a href='https://www.rosario341.com.br' target='_blank'>website here</a> and get a little bit of our vibe in our <a href='https://www.instagram.com/rosario341/' target='_blank'>Instagram</a> and <a href='https://www.facebook.com/ROSARIO341/' target='_blank'>Facebook</a> </p>.
